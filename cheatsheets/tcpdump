# Basic Usage #
###############

#Capture packets on a particular interface (eth0)
#Note that tcpdump (without the '-i eth0') is also valid if you are only using one interface
tcpdump -i eth0

#Capture packets with more detailed output
tcpdump -i eth0 -nnvvS

#Display captured packets in both HEX and ASCII format
tcpdump -XX -i eth0

#Write captured packets into a file (can be read by tools such as Wireshark, Snort, etc)
tcpdump -w yourfilename.pcap -i eth0

#Read packets from a saved packet capture file
tcpdump -tttt -r yoursavedfile.pcap

#Display IP addresses instead of hostnames when capturing packets
tcpdump -n -i eth0

#Capture packets from a particular source/destination IP address
tcpdump src 192.168.1.1
tcpdump dst 192.168.1.1

#Capture packets from a particular source/destination port number
tcpdump src port 53
tcpdump dst port 21

#Capture an entire network's traffic using CIDR notation
tcpdump net 192.168.1.0/24

#Capture traffic to or from a port
tcpdump port 3389

#Display captured packets above or below a certain size (in bytes)
tcpdump less 64
tcpdump greater 256

# Advanced Usage #
##################

#More complex statements can be formed with the use of logical operators: and(&&), or(||), not(!)
#Examples:

#Capture all traffic from 192.168.1.10 with destination port 80 (with verbose output)
tcpdump -nnvvS and src 192.168.1.10 and dst port 80

#Capture traffic originating from the 172.16.0.0/16 network with destination network 192.168.1.0/24 or 10.0.0.0/8
tcpdump src net 172.16.0.0/16 and dst net 192.168.1.0/24 or 10.0.0.0/8

#Capture all traffic originating from host H1 that isn't going to port 53
tcpdump src H1 and not dst port 22

#With some complex queries you may have to use single quotes to ignore special characters, namely parentheses 
#Capture traffic from 192.168.1.1 that is destined for ports 80 and 21
tcpdump 'src 192.168.1.1 and (dst port 80 or 21)'
# TCPDump is a packet analyzer. It allows the user to intercept and display TCP/IP
# and other packets being transmitted or received over a network. (cf Wikipedia).
# Note: 173.194.40.120 => google.com

# Intercepts all packets on eth0
tcpdump -i eth0

# Intercepts all packets from/to 173.194.40.120
tcpdump host 173.194.40.120

# Intercepts all packets on all interfaces from / to 173.194.40.120 port 80
# -nn => Disables name resolution for IP addresses and port numbers.
tcpdump -nn -i any host 173.194.40.120 and port 80

# Make a grep on tcpdump (ASCII)
# -A  => Show only ASCII in packets.
# -s0 => By default, tcpdump only captures 68 bytes.
tcpdump -i -A any host 173.194.40.120 and port 80 | grep 'User-Agent'

# With ngrep
# -d eth0 => To force eth0 (else ngrep work on all interfaces)
# -s0 => force ngrep to look at the entire packet. (Default snaplen: 65536 bytes)
ngrep 'User-Agent' host 173.194.40.120 and port 80

# Intercepts all packets on all interfaces from / to 8.8.8.8 or 173.194.40.127 on port 80
tcpdump 'host ( 8.8.8.8 or 173.194.40.127 ) and port 80' -i any

# Intercepts all packets SYN and FIN of each TCP session.
tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0'

# To display SYN and FIN packets of each TCP session to a host that is not on our network
tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0 and not src and dst net local_addr'

# To display all IPv4 HTTP packets that come or arrive on port 80 and that contain only data (no SYN, FIN no, no packet containing an ACK)
tcpdump 'tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)'

# Saving captured data
tcpdump -w file.cap

# Reading from capture file
tcpdump -r file.cap

# Show content in hexa
# Change -x to -xx => show extra header (ethernet).
tcpdump -x

# Show content in hexa and ASCII
# Change -X to -XX => show extra header (ethernet).
tcpdump -X

# Note on packet maching:
# Port matching:
# - portrange 22-23
# - not port 22
# - port ssh
# - dst port 22
# - src port 22
#
# Host matching:
# - dst host 8.8.8.8
# - not dst host 8.8.8.8
# - src net 67.207.148.0 mask 255.255.255.0
# - src net 67.207.148.0/24
